# EventEase - A One-Stop Event Planning Hub
## Project Idea
EventEase is a web-based event planning platform designed to simplify and streamline the process of organizing small-scale events such as weddings, birthdays, and local festivals. The platform connects event planners with vendors, offers real-time event execution tracking, and enhances collaboration through task assignments and guest management.
